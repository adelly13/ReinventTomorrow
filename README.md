## About Us
Started by a group of three high school students, Adelina Chau, Jenny Kim, and Yuli Choi, Reinvent Tomorrow is an organization dedicated to educating middle school students on the fundamentals of business while bridging the equity gap in the business world. As active members of our schoolâ€™s Business club, we noticed that in the business world, minorities/people of color consistently held lower rankings or were subjected to biased treatment. Only 23% of CEOs are women, and only 11% of CEOs are people of color. By raising awareness towards this issue and offering the opportunity to learn more about business, we hope to bring about change and make an impact on the next generation of business leaders.
